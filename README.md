# ARSA_ML Application
This is a streamlit application built on top of the arsa_ml Python package available on PyPI. It allows experimentation with the package functionalities in a no-code manner using pre-saved datasets and trained models. 

# Application pages
### Home page
Home page provides a brief overview of the package features, key concepts, and definiions related to the Rashomon Set. 
### Datasets page
Datasets page contains detailed descriptions of pre-saved datasets available for analysis alongside with the sources and numerical characteristics.

### Rashomon page
Primary page for analysis of the Rashomon Effect. It allows custom parameter selection and in depth analysis of the Rashomon Set properties.
